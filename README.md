Adv. Java with Android Studio S1

This is an overview of everything I learned in AP CSA.
Simple demonstration of class/object creation, usage of getter/setter methods, brain methods, and toString method. Demonstrates constructor class, and abstract
class usage. Project requirements: 

4 instance variables of different types.
2 standard constructors
2 constructors with limited parameter lists
getters and setters for all variables
2 brain methods
toString

The abstract class and monster class where done together as a class. I wrote the rest of the classes and driver tests.
